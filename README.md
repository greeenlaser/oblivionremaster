# INFO
It is not recommended to use the indev version because it may contain buggy code that might not work or it may break your games progress.
Indev versions also always update to the latest LTS version so that means you may need multiple unity versions if you plan on using both main and indev branches.

# REQUIRED INDEV BRANCH UNITY VERSION
2021.3.12f1 LTS

# ART AND AUDIO FOLDER DOWNLOADS
Art and audio files are not updated in the indev branch. If you want to download and try out the indev version and you are missing any files then DM me on discord greenlaser#1234

# HOW TO UPDATE
1) switch to indev branch on your git software
2) pull the indev branch
